### New Features
- Added regex/log filter support which can be configured in server.json. (does not work on Hytale)
  - This allows you to remove things you don't want to see in console (like a certain griefing group)

### Changes
- The built-in discord bot has been enabled for Hytale servers
  - It only tracks chat between discord and server, as well as join/quit messages.
